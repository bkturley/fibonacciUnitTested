 USER STORY

As a <type of user>,
I want <to perform some task>
so that I can <achieve some goal/benefit/value>.

As a user, 
I want to see the sum of all numbers in the geometric series 
       a=3 r=2 that are multiples of 2 up to a given upper limit,
so that I can compare the sum of multiple of 2 terms in the geometric
       sequence to the sum of multiple of 2 terms in the Fibonacci sequence.

  ACCEPTANCE CRITERA
  
  Given [context]
  And   [some more context]…
  When  [event]
  Then  [outcome]
  And   [another outcome]…
  
  Given I run the application
  When  the sum of all multiples of 2 fibs is displayed
  Then  the sum of geometric sequence a=3, r=2  5 fibs is displayed.
